## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

These instructions will guide you through installing dependencies and running the game locally in development mode.

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or above recommended)  
  Download: https://nodejs.org/

To verify installation, run:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 📦 Installing Dependencies

Once Node.js is installed, open a terminal in the root of this project and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages listed in ```package.json```.

### 🚀 Running the Game (Development Mode)
After installing dependencies, start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see terminal output like:

```bash
> template-esbuild-ts@1.2.1 dev
> node log.js dev & node esbuild/dev.server.mjs -w


Serving 🍛

Local → http://localhost:8080
```
Open that link in your browser to start playing!

### 🪲 If Something Goes Wrong
If ```npm run dev``` fails, try resetting the environment:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

If all else fails don't hesistate to reach out ✉️ (s2153660@ed.ac.uk).

## 📁 Project Structure
The key components of the project structure. Every file in ```src``` that does not say ```pre-generated``` was written specifically for this project. This project was generated as a blank Phaser.js template designed to be compiled in TS specifically. The original template can be found at this GitHub repository (https://github.com/phaserjs/template-esbuild-ts).
